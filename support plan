  ⎿ This was a research task to analyze and document 
    the existing support features in the Core1 
    E-commerce platform. No implementation work is 
    needed - I've provided a comprehensive overview 
    of:

    1. Support Ticket System - Complete admin
    interface with ticket management, categories,
    priorities, and status workflow
    2. Live Chat System - Database structure for
    real-time messaging with agent assignment and file     
     support
    3. Customer Support Integration - Planned features     
     including FAQ, VoIP, and escalation workflows
    4. Admin Management Tools - Full-featured support      
    dashboard with filtering, search, and quick
    actions
    5. API Infrastructure - RESTful endpoints for
    customer support interactions
    6. Multi-channel Support - Tickets linked to
    orders with comprehensive workflow management

    The platform has a robust support infrastructure       
    already in place with both ticketing and live chat     
     capabilities.
